## Overview

A somewhat broken, decently thought out software version of the popular game Carcassonne. Currently, the project is realized using a modified server/client architecture.

## Setup

The Java Runtime Environment is required (1.6 or higher). After this is done, the program can be executed either by cloning the repository and building from source, or by grabbing the newest version available on the project's downloads page.
