# Carcassonne

## Overview

A very broken, poorly thought out software version of the popular game Carcassonne. Currently, the project is realized using a server/client architecture. This is the server component. The client component can be found [here](https://github.com/awylie/Carcassonne-Client) (the Carcassonne-Client repository).

## Usage

The server component can be run using java via the command line as follows:

    java -jar CarcassonneServer.jar <port number>


The client component can be run without any command line options, as the network configuration is set in the UI (options screen).

## Setup

The Java Runtime Environment is required (1.6 or higher). After this is done, the program can be executed either by cloning the repository and building from source, or by grabbing the newest version available on the project's downloads page.
